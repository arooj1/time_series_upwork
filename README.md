# ANOMALY DETECTION

# MOTIVATION
https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/

# WORK REQUIRED
**Project Work** Start time - 11:30 AM 

**Stage-1**  DONE
- Run code from the link shared: 
https://keras.io/examples/timeseries/timeseries_anomaly_detection/ 

Issues: 
1- dataset path changed. Fixed in the present code. 

2- Tensorflow latest version required to run the model. Refer to this link for the solution: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/40937


**Stage-2**
Objective:

1- create function for the expected output file with the following columns

- group_id
- threshold
- MAE value
- Anomaly [yes/no]

2- validate by applying it on one of the test dataset groups
